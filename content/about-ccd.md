The Center for Collaborative Democracy is a non-profit, nonpartisan tax exempt 501 (c) 3 organization. CCD grew out of the MIT-Harvard Public Disputes Program, which for two decades has refereed political conflicts from local housing battles to worldwide environmental clashes.

CCD’s mission is to develop innovative methods that will enable legislatures — from town councils to the U.S. Congress — to resolve their differences as constructively as possible, and thereby reach fair, sensible agreements on critical issues.

CCD’s operational goals include:

*   Informing citizens and civic leaders across the country about how to produce more effective government in their hometowns;
*   Helping those citizens and leaders implement reforms that will produce more collaborative local government;
*   Monitoring the results and disseminating word about them.
