The Center for Collaborative Democracy (CCD) is a non-profit, nonpartisan tax exempt 501 (c) 3 organization that grew out of the MIT-Harvard Public Disputes Program.

CCDâ€™s mission is to develop innovative methods that will encourage policymakers at all levels of government to resolve their differences as constructively as possible, and thereby reach fair, sensible agreements on critical issues.

CCD is currently focused on a project called the Forum for Long-Term Propserity, which will bring together the men and women whom the American people would most trust to solve our country's economic problems. The Forum's purpose is to develop a combination of economic reforms that will restore our country's fiscal health and promote wide prosperity. The Forum will then present its plan to the American people.
