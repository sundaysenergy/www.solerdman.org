The Center for Collaborative Democracy (CCD) is a non-profit, nonpartisan tax exempt 501 (c) 3 organization that grew out of the MIT-Harvard Public Disputes Program.

CCD’s mission is to develop innovative methods that will encourage policymakers at all levels of government to resolve their differences as constructively as possible, and thereby reach fair, sensible agreements on critical issues.

CCD’s operational goals include:

*   Informing citizens and civic leaders across the country about how to produce more effective government in their hometowns;
*   Helping those citizens and leaders implement reforms that will produce more collaborative local government;
*   Monitoring the results and disseminating word about them.
