Sol Erdman is the founder and president of the Center for Collaborative Democracy (CCD) and co-author of The Cure for Our Broken Political Process: How We Can Get Our Politicians to Resolve the Issues Tearing Our Country Apart (Potomac Books, 2008).

In the words of Larry Sabato, director of the Institute for Politics at the University of Virginia, The Cure is a “daring book” that “carefully dissects the problems with our system [of government] and proposes a novel way to turn it around. Stretch your mind and read this book.”

Amory Houghton, a member of Congress from 1987 to 2004 and the former CEO of Corning Glass Works, says that The Cure is “brilliantly written. It presents the kind of government we might aspire to in the years ahead.”
